### Notes

Docker not working on [[Julie Ops Playground]] so I deleted all the environment now usin the [[Kafka Docker Playground]] forked from [[Vincent de Saboulin]]

Added apl_testJulie to ldap_users
> [!success] RBAC Cluster
> look at [[Kafka Docker Playground]] for docker config setup for RBAC with LDAP listener callback
> Julie Configuration for RBAC with LDAP and SR

> [!warning]
> Not posible have more than a file with topic config under the same folder, julie error merging existing project on subtopologies ASK PERE
> Consumer Group permission not deleted even with `allow.delete.bindings=true` set in topology builder properties

#todo 
- [ ] Pull request to [[Vincent de Saboulin]] for the LDAP callback
- [ ] Ask [[Pere Urbon]] how we can have more than a file for topic definiton on the same project
