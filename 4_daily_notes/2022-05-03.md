### Topic:
Daily
### Attendees:
* [[Miguel Angel Garcia De La Cruz]]
* [[Abel Alvarez Fernandez]]
* [[Ivan YaÃ±ez]]
* [[Juan Pablo De Frutos]]

### Notes:

- Prepare tomorrow's session if testing community
- Prepare the testing repo example for Spring, Plain Java and Kstreams
- Check in memory server file creation
- Incidence of permission on Kstreams
	- [[Juan Pablo De Frutos]] has to check Active Directory cache to solve timeouts on MDS checks -> this has no effect on the incidence of under replication of the permission topics but can help on performance
	- Incidence with MDS on the broker outage (VMotion Incident)
- Upgrade KSQL:
	- The RocksDB folder is a subfolder of the cache one and when KSQL delete it also delete the RocksDB
	- This no happens on normal situation because the queries has no cache.
	- Will update the incident case and follow the instructions
- Quotas on PRO
	- activate a fake quota to enable the metrics
	- they complains that only can see quotas metrics by clientID not by user (not sure if the create quota by user so they can't see any)
