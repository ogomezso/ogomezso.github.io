### Notes

#### Updates

xDS API for larger use cases -> rethink the while thing
http3 adoption GA

#### Envoy Gateway

#repos  [Envoy Gateway](https://github.com/envoyproxy/gateway)

Standard API to run envoy as k8s Ingress Gateway

> [!question]
>  Kafka protocol, perhaps can be a option instead of having a filter

### Notes

> [!tip] Charateristics of Trust
> Time dependant
> Asymmetrical
> Contextual

with Istio Network not the first placee of perimeter defense anymore but in the workload itself


level 7 phto to match instead of securing the protocol

when you communicate between different BU the decision is not in who knows the messages so we need to transalate the paettern to infra level so all the component have the same photograpic policy at l7

In the e go with a identity for all level on our app from hardware tpm to app itself going through the pod and mesh

On this the best practice is to have the IDP on sepaate INFRa to no compromise the whole thing in case of compromise

SPIRE standard implementation for IDP for mesh (Istio already work with it) so you can have he IDP of your mesh on separate identity.

> [!important] SPIRE killing features
> Unique standards and formats
> Federate APIs by default
> reduce the impact of compromised clusters

### Notes

> [!hint]
> Istio converts the app to app policy on a end user to infra resource using end user credentials itself

> [!warning]
>  Great with coffee for all but no at fine grain, This is not very maintaniable

> [!summary] KEy points to be able to microsegmentation
>  Ownership
>  Hierachy
>  Abstraction

#### Hierachy

Basic with Istio: root sn vs local ns

This is not real world Infra don't use to be aligned with this

#### Abstraction

Write Istio config is hard


2 levels:

1. Config itself minimun requiere to fdo your work (helm template??)
2. Runtime: the policy mut be portable around all the mesh 81 cluster, any cluster, namespace level

#### Ownership

shift left approach... every team has to be able to write their own policies

but which ones you must allow  -> k8s not very great on this

OpenAPI Spec!!! (perhaps AsyncAPI for us??)


> [!warning] Hierical Namespaces
> Istio doesn't work with it for the moment
> need to check if it is on the backlog

### Notes

> dynamic vs static config
> istio control plane in whic envoy had their dynamic config


Foto building blocks -> listeners on the middle of each one

#### Listener

Listener -> go through listener filters and then finish on optional ones that can choose for you the apropiate one based on request data.

#### Cluster

Bunch of similar upstreams hosts (similar to k8's concept services vs replicas)


Envoy use to have a cluster level config where you define th cluster where it will grab the config so you can reduce your config and do it dynamically

### Notes

> [!hint]
>  Istio as key infra to get the resilience patter on Release It book

> [!summary] Ingress & Egress
>  Edge are K8s Deployments
>  you can use istio gateway instead of ingress controller
>  you can use AS ingress controller
>  > [!question]
>  > what happens with apps outside the mesh?? can use this new gateway
