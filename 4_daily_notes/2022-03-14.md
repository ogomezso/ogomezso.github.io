### Notes:

#### DELETION OF REPLICATED TOPICS
- Possibility to have C3 dashboarding several clusters on the organisation
- Is possibility to have compact and delete at the same time on the same topic
- Topic purge
	- Owners of public topics wants a fresh start for topic data:
		- Asume that consumers will lost data
		- Asume the extra work of:
			- plan the stop of production
			- be aware of client consumes all the data
		- delete topic
			- new schema coming -> consumers must adapt their schemas
	- Think more about schema evolution or create new one.
	- AVRO over Json:
		- more compression
		- nested object
	- Application uses JSON Schemas -> AVRO search for schema infer!
	- new version of topic for matter of time on consumers adaption (during the migration) -> just migrating last versions
	- No purge permitted
	- In future they will need to create a third with the proper schema
#### GROUPING Strategy
- Additional offsets [https://support.confluent.io/hc/en-us/requests/92181](https://support.confluent.io/hc/en-us/requests/92181 "https://support.confluent.io/hc/en-us/requests/92181")
- https://eventsizer.io/ -> Sizing Connect Instances
-  EXPERIMENT WITH AUTOSCALING TO DESCALING... IN K8S FOR CONNECT
