### Topic:
Mongo DB Source Connector Issues
### Attendees:

* [[Abel Alvarez Fernandez]]
* [[Juan Soto]]
* Mariano Robledo (ADN 360)
### Notes:

> [!summary]
> - Custom Writer to filter on Mongo Arrays 
> - Ticket opened with Mongo, when the `batch.size` property is set up to 1 the Connector stop consuming after `duplicated key errors` on mongo and finally fails with `consumer poll timeout exception`

> [!note] Notes
> The arrays they are trying to UPSERT are not idempotent so is very difficult to manage the merge on the connector side.
> Mongo connector up to 1.6 delegate the error handling on the driver itself so when we got duplicated keys seems that the driver is not responding ok.
> The is some [issues](https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/KAFKA/issues/KAFKA-269?filter=allopenissues) about retrying on Mongo Source Connector
> 

> [!check] Next Steps
> 1. Our recommendation is to modify the Mongo Model splitting the problematic arrays on subdocument managing this way the complexity where it belongs
> 2. Changes the flows of data to Mongo, this way we will have atomic and idempotent `upsert`
>
> Dev Team still pending on the response of Mongo Support about batch size property but we still thing that the model & flow change must be the long term solution
> In the meanwhile as workaround we can try with Mongo Connector version 1.6 to control the retries on the connector not in the driver or, if Mongo support solves the issue with the 1.7
