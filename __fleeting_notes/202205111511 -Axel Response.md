Hi Axel,

First to all I want to thank your support on this, means a lot to me.

I really understand your point on this and I have to say that all are really good ones that I need to take in count very carefully (for example the improvement opportunities on my carreer path and the room I would have to put my ideas to work on a real backlog  are some of my main concerns).

Something that is sticking on my mind is that I have the impression that you are thinking that it is not a good move for me and I will really appreciate hear why you think so (if that the case), at the end of the day you know this company and the other teams much better than me.

From my perspective as I said to you many times I'm happy on PS and I think I have a lot of room to improve (also think that I already did a huge improvement :) ), and I can see myself in the future as tech lead on the team. 

The only thing that perhaps I miss on my current position is that there is nothing that I feel like a real challenge on the daily work with clients, my use cases on this year was pretty straight fordward (kafka 101, and cluster installation) but nothing really challenging on architectural design part, for example, so sometimes I feel that I can't really improve my technical side.

Beside of that I enjoy and learn a lot working with all the people on PS Team, I really There is where I found my technical curiosity feed

So perhaps something that can help me a lot too is understand what is your vision for me within the team gonna say the next year or two and how we can work together on this feelings I've got now.

So again I want to be clear on that I haven't made any decision yet (I still need to check and clarify some of this main points) and my priotity now is help PS Teams andI will not make any movement that could harm the team.

Again many many thanks for your support, and perhaps we have to have a call to talk a bit more about this.

Regards
