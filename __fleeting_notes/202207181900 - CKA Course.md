### Namespaces

> [!summary] Namespace
>  Virtual Clusters backed by the same physical ones.
>  K8s Resources lives on namespaces.
>  Namespaces are a way to organize resources. 
>  Typically this resources will now see between different namespaces

### Pre-Existing Namespaces

> [!note] default
> Pre created on all K8s Clusters.
> K8s will asume as namespace when no one is declared on the command.

> [!note] kube-system
>  Used for System Components such as _Control plane_ components itself.
>

> [!note] kube-node-lease
>   This namespace holds Lease objects associated with each node. 
>   Node leases allow the _kubelet_ to send heartbeats so that the control plane can detect node

> [!note] kube-public
>This namespace is created automatically and is readable by all users (including those not authenticated). This namespace is mostly reserved for cluster usage, in case that some resources should be visible and readable publicly throughout the whole cluster. 

### Operations

> [!note] Namespace creation
> kubectl create namespace {my-namespace}

> [!note]
> You can specify the namespace on every command of _kubectl_ adding `--namespace` or `-n`. or list on all with `--all-namespaces`
