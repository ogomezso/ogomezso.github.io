### Notes:

#### Istio Traffic Management

```ad-note
title: service discovery

Istio uses K8's Service Discovery to mantain its own.



```
```ad-note
title: Pilot

Pilot adapters register automatically the services

```
```ad-note
title: ingress-gateway

 Istio Ingress Gateway alongside K8s Ingress (you can use Istio Ingress as default to) provide you al routing, security and monitoring features. 

```
```ad-note
title: external traffic

By default envoy passthrough all unknown services so any traffic is permited. You can restrict this applying somo outbound traffic policy.

You also can use a Istio Egress Gateway to centralice the external traffic there
