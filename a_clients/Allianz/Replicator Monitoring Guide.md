### Goals

Provide guidelines and asset to monitor the migration process

### Monitoring

We will be monitoring a *self managed replicator instance* deployed on a Kubernetes cluster (EKS).
The monitoring stack will be based on *Prometheus / Grafana Stack*.

You will find grafana dashboards for Kubernetes on [[#References]]$^1$. 

There are several metrics that are important to take care during the migration process.

#### Replicator Metrics

[Official Doc]((https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/multi-dc-deployments/replicator/replicator-monitoring.html#important-crep-metrics)

You can find it alongside another useful *Kafka Connect* metrics on the [Kafka Connect Dashboard](https://github.com/ogomezso/cfk-dashboards/blob/main/cfk-kafka-connect-cluster.json)
