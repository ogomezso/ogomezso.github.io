# Introduction

We together found that we can take more advantage of our enablement time if we can put some structure and purpose on it.

We definitely think that being able to work together on a SIG (Special Interest Group), following the CNCF terminology, can be a great advantage.

On this pager we propose adpat Chapters and Guilds from Sportify Model as a collaboration model. 

# Goals

1. Create a space and structure around Enablement Days/Weeks that Confluent Teams can use to get the most from our enablement time
2. Do it on a more (re)usable way so we can go from individual learning to actual useful cross functional assets for our day to day work and new joiners ramp up.
3. Give visibility to the work we do on those days through the team, organisation, and perhaps the tech community.

# Chapter

> [!hint] Chapters Defintion
> Chapters are the family that each specialist has, helping to keep engineering standards in place across a discipline. Chapters are typically led by a senior technology lead.

> [!question] who can be part of a chapter
> Every employee should be part of their Chapter's Role. In order to do it feasible regional chapters can be created. Chapters lead need to synchronize practices and goals

## Chapter Organization

- **Regional Chapter Lead:** Senior Technical Lead of a specific role that coordinate the work of a specific region
- **Chapter Leads Board:** Board formed for Regional Chapter Leads of a specific role across regions.
- **Chapter Lead Member:** Every employee of the company that owns a specific role.

## How To

- Chapter Leads has periodic one on ones meetings with chapter members
- Chapter Lead Board have periodic meeting to align goals and practices
- There is a periodic region Chapter Meeting to share news and knowledge Exchange (Guild presentations and updates, new from chapter board, etc)

# Guilds

> [!hint] Guild Definition
> A Guild is a organic and wide-reaching “community of interest”, a group of people that want to share knowledge, tools, code, and practices.
 
> [!question] Who can be part of a guild?
> Anyone through the entire organization that have interest on that specific topic.
>       
> In order to facilitate the team work, organisation and meetings ideally guild office hours must exits. Guild Contributors have to be spread over all regions and must be on sync.

> [!question] What is the scope of a guild?
> Ideally a guild should have a clear general topic (Kubernetes and CFK, KStreams & KSQL, Gitops, Testing, ...).
> And several actionable projects with a clear input and output (CFK Field experience driven runbooks, Kstreams best practices document, ...)

## Guild Organization

Considering our team topology and way of working and culture we think a Open Source project structure approach can be good fit:

- **Maintainers:** Members that owns the guild and are accountable of the organization and success of the initiatives.
- **Contributors:** Active members of the guild that actually own tasks or projects of it on a end to end way.
- **End Users:** Member that just need help or input from the Guild, eventually can help mantainers or contributors on specifics task but not as owners of it.

## How to

1. Each guild have their own Confluence Page where publicly announce their news, project status and public meetings.
2. Each guild owns a public and private (only for maintainers and contributors) slack channel.
3. Each guild have their own public backlog (jira, trello, asana board (preferred)) to organise and give visibility their work.
4. Each guild will have a publicly posted office hours on every Enablement Day (the first Friday of every month), in which:
	1. Review status of each project
	2. Prioritize (and refine) guild backlog
	3. Help team members on specific problems around the guild topic.
5. Maintainers of each guild will write a Newsletter or similar to keep the rest of the team posted of their work.
6. Ideally active guild members will have specific OKRs related to the guild work.
7. Ideally active guild members (maintainers and contributors) should have the posibiity of sync their enablement weeks to work together in specilally complicated topics.

# Guild / Project Pool Creation

- Chapter Leads push a new project on the pool and search for guild mantainers / contributors:
	- Company Surveys
	- Skill matrix
	- Company POI

- Guild Mantainers / Contributors / End users ask Chapter Leads for a new guild/project creation:
	- Company Value based personal interest
	- Client Interest

- Chapter Leads prioritize and assign time to new guilds/projects and guide them to have a clear and valuable output
-
