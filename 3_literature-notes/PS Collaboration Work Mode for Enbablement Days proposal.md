# Introduction

We together found that we can take more advantage of our enablement time if we can put some structure and purpose on it.

We definitely think that being able to work together on a SIG (Special Interest Group), following the CNCF terminology, can be a great advantage.

On these pager we propose adpat Guilds from Sportify Model as a collaboration model. 

# Goals

1. Create a space and structure around Enablement Days/Weeks that PS (nad extended) Team can use to get the most from our enablement
2. Do it on a more (re)usable way so we can go from individual learning to actual useful assets for our day to day work and new joiners ramp up.
3. Give visibility to the work we do on those days through the team and organisation.

# Core concepts

> [!hint] Guild Definition
> A Guild is a organic and wide-reaching “community of interest”, a group of people that want to share knowledge, tools, code, and practices.
 
> [!question] Who can be part of a guild?
> Anyone through PS Organization that have interest on that specific topic.
>       
> In order to facilitate the team work, organisation and meetings ideally guild members should be on the same region (EMEA, America, APAC). Nevertheless several regional with the same topic can exists at the same time and combine efforts on a async way.

> [!question] What is the scope of a guild?
> Ideally a guild should have a clear general topic (Kubernetes and CFK, KStreams & KSQL, Gitops, Testing, ...).
> And several executable projects with a clear input and output (CFK Field experience driven runbooks, Kstreams best practices document, ...)

# Guild Organization

Considering our team topology and way of working and culture we think a Open Source project structure approach can be good fit:

- **Maintainers:** Members that owns the guild and are accountable of the organization and success of the initiatives.
- **Contributors:** Active members of the guild that actually own tasks or projects of it on a end to end way.
- **End Users:** Member that just need help or input from the Guild, eventually can help mantainers or contributors on specifics task but not as owners of it.

# How to

1. Each guild have their own Confluence Page where publicly announce their news, project status and public meetings.
2. Each guild owns a public and private (only for maintainers and contributors) slack channel.
3. Each guild have their own public backlog (jira, trello, asana board (preferred)) to organise and give visibility their work.
4. Each guild will have a publicly posted office hours on every Enablement Day (thefirst Friday of every month), in which:
	1. Review status of each project
	2. Prioritize (and refine) guild backlog
	3. Help team members on specific problems around the guild topic.
5. Maintainers of each guild will write a Newsletter or similar to keep the rest of the team posted of their work.
6. Ideally active guild members will have specific OKRs related to the guild work.
7. Ideally active guild members (maintainers and contributors) should have the posibiity of sync their enablement weeks to work together in specilally complicated topics.
