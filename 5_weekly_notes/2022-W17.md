- [[Jose Alberto Rollon]] will develop use case with Cucumber but depends on *dedicates devops testing team* to update the proper archetype 
- Community Meeting to show the library an examples of use for next week [[Jose Alberto Rollon]] will send invites
- ADN360 starts a use case with [[parallel_consumer]] so will setup a meeting to check the use case focus on the unit testing.

> [!question] What about of non-tx Consumers?
> Consumers configured wit `isolation.level=READ_UNCOMMITED` will behaive as "normal consumer" that means that will read and store the specific offset without taking care if is commmited or not
> That implies that if we lost connection before the producer commits the message will the read the same.
> In plain Java lock the article above the producer have control when the commit is done so we can commit after send several messages that only can be readed if are commited (in the case os "transactional consumer"). But because we have indempotent producers in place there is no room for duplicated messages in any case.
> On top of that we are working with Spring Kafka Transaction manager that do the commit for us using the `@Transactional` annotation for do it.

> [!note] Next Steps
> Try the case of batch consuming with transaction within all the events (we have to remember that they are sent one by one).

#todo 
- [x] Improve example with batch consuming/produce
- [ ] Improve [[Kafka Clients Benchmark]] with this use case
