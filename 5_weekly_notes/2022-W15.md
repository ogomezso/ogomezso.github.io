### Notes:

- PROD done, the extra config:
	- transaction timeout
	- producer timeout
	- stream threads
	- max poll records
	will be kept until next update (upgrade of ksql version)
- Today focus on:
	- Jorge: PREPROD env
	- Oscar: Parallel consumer and functional test
- Question about support work mode, yesterday opened a P1 case. And they are happy with the call mode. We said that is one of the options but it can't be the regular mode and only for production issues, these kind of things comes through [[Javier Jimenez]]
