### Topic:

### Attendees:
* [[Miguel Angel Garcia De La Cruz]]
* [[Abel Alvarez Fernandez]]
* [[Ivan Ya単ez]]
* [[Juan Pablo De Frutos]]

### Notes:
- Prepare tomorrow's session if testing community
- Prepare the testing repo example for Spring, Plain Java and Kstreams
- Check in memory server file creation
- **Incidence of permission on Kstreams**
	- [[Juan Pablo De Frutos]] has to check **Active Directory** cache to solve timeouts on MDS checks -> this has no effect on the incidence of under replication of the permission topics but can help on performance
	- Incidence with MDS on the broker outage (VMotion Incident)
- **Upgrade KSQL**
	- The RocksDB folder is a subfolder of the cache one and when KSQL delete it also delete the RocksDB
	- This no happens on normal situation because the queries has no cache.
	- Will update the incident case and follow the instructions
- **Quotas on PRO**
	- activate a fake quota to enable the metrics
	- they complains that only can see quotas metrics by clientID not by user (not sure if the create quota by user so they can't see any)

- Planning to move the VMs stopping gracefully components one by one. We don't expect any service outage. 
	- May 9th from 15 to 18h enable VPC configs to be able to move vm clusters (graceful stops of componentes one by one) 
	- May 11th from 14 to 20 move Platform components to new VMWare cluster.
- [[Abel Alvarez Fernandez]] will share Julie Ops test use case to implement
- [[Miguel Angel Garcia De La Cruz]] raise a question about config on HDFS3 connector vs HDFS2 regarding Hive.

### Notes:

- Syslog connector to replace flume (5 agents).
	- Concerns:
		- Put in HA
		- Load Balancer not seems to be a option ("matar moscas a ca単onazos")
		- Need to meet Fernando Diaz Gallego to go deep on the use case.
- Julie Ops use case for next monday
- [[Kafka Test Utils]] officially delivered. 
	- Next Steps: put on pipeline
	- Discuss with Arquitectura.
- Journal new prod incidence with lost of data.
	- Big Data admins can't see anything on the cluster or traces
	- All point to a App problem
	- Big Data Admins will check broker logs of the incidence time and comeback to us

![[{{Santander}} Syslog_usecase_diagram.png]]

![[{{Santander}} Syslog_event_example.png]]

> [!danger] Concerns
>  This piece need to be on HA mode so we need at least to intances. Since Syslog connector can't have more than a task (recommendation is deploy ir on standalone mode) how we can do it on a "standard cluster":
>   > [!question]
>   > Can we deploy more than a connector in the same distribute cluster (with 1 max task configured) if so there is any way to be sure that will be deployed on different workers?. 
>   > Can we have kind of sticky call to that worker (client side)?

> [!info] Volumetry
> 250k events/day

> [!question] Suggestion
> Deploy it on a K8s namespace wit CFK as stand alone pods and put a service wrapping them.

### Topic:
Kafka Test Utils lifecycle process
### Attendees:
* [[Abel Alvarez Fernandez]]
* [[Jose Alberto Rollon]]
* [[Lucia Lopez]]
* [[Daniel Villanueva]]

### Notes:

In memory server and [[Kafka Test Utils]] must be on separate artifacts (with mutual dependency each other)

2 options for the deployment:

1. Architecture Team will be responsible of the In memory server, will grab it from my repo and get into theirs. [[Jose Alberto Rollon]] will be in charge of Kafka test utils part with its own pipe
2. Architecture responsible of both of them and the pipeline

No problems with the original versioning proposal

Next Steps:

- Upload the last version to [[Jose Alberto Rollon]]
- [[Daniel Villanueva]] will check with his team the option 2 and provide repositories for both of the libraries.

* Journal Team

### Notes:
- Degradation of performance with transactionality on the micros tested on local is about a 5% (pending to test in PRE env)
> [!question] Next Steps
> Put transactional code on all the chain and deploy in PROD
> Next monday 18h -> functional and resilency test

- Lost of msgs in the past days:
	- No evidence of platform failure, we only can see a few peeks on the out throughput (all point to GDO) but still didn't explain the errors
	- Taking a look of the first APP point is a very messy spring boot app that is running a KStreams inside (plain Kstream library) with heavy processing on the consume (calls to ORACLE, Mongo even DB2) (principal suspect for the error)
