### 2022-07-04-12:00 Cloudera CDH ENV Migration Playground

### Notes

The main goal is have a cloudera environment with Kafka and SR to migrate to CP 7.01
Download the image from docker hub

~~~
docker pull cloudera/quickstart:5.7.0-0-beta
~~~

```bash
docker run --name quickstart.cloudera \
  --hostname=quickstart.cloudera \
  -d --privileged=true \
  -t -i cloudera-5-13 \
  /usr/bin/docker-quickstart
```

after that you run the image

~~~sh
docker run --name quickstart.cloudera \
  --hostname=quickstart.cloudera \
  -d --privileged=true \
  -p 8888:8888 -p 7180:7180 -p 8181:80 -p 9092:9092\
  -t -i cloudera/quickstart:5.7.0-beta \
  /usr/bin/docker-quickstart

~~~

> [!error]
> Not able to run cloudera manager or Kafka inside.  
> not worthy to spend much more time so will asume the same behaviour that will have with plain SR

### Notes

> [!check]
> The main purpose is to check the following scenarios
> - Schema Translation with empty destination SR, Are the ids preserved?
> - schema translation with exisisting schemas on destination SR


#repos [replicator playground](https://github.com/ogomezso/replicator-playground.git)


Set up docker environment

![[Drawing 2022-07-05 11.18.56_replicator_overview.excalidraw]]

At first try didn't fails not finding the jar file. Change to replicator specific image

#### Schema Translation with Fresh SR

1. Create a datagen source connector (This will create a new subject on src Schema Registry) running `connect/submit_users_datagen.sh`
2. Set Import mode on Destiny SR by running `set_sr_mode_pre_translation.sh`
3. Create `schema_translation_replicator`  by running `replicator/submit_schema_translation_replicator.sh`
4. Check the schema was created on DEST Schema Registry with the same id by running `curl http://localhost:8082/subjects/datagen_users-value/versions/1`
5. Restore READWRITE mode on DEST SR by running  `set_sr_mode_post_translation.sh`.

   > [!warning]
> Once you restore this mode new schemas created on SRC Schema Registry will be NOT REPLICATED to the DEST SR.
> Since DEST SCHEMA Registry will be not empty anymore your won't be able to put in IMPORT mode. 


#### Schema Translation creating new Subjects on SRC SR

Create a new Schema on destination:
1. Create a datagen source connector (This will create a new subject on src Schema Registry) running `connect/submit_users_datagen.sh`
2. Set Import mode on Destiny SR by running `set_sr_mode_pre_translation.sh`
3. Create `schema_translation_replicator`  by running `replicator/submit_schema_translation_replicator.sh`
4. Check the schema was created on DEST Schema Registry with the same id by running `curl http://localhost:8082/subjects/datagen_users-value/versions/1`
5. Create a datagen source connector (This will create a new subject on src Schema Registry) running `connect/submit_orders_datagen.sh`
6. Check that the new schema was created on DEST Schema Registry by running `curl http://localhost:8082/subjects/datagen_orders-value/versions/1`
7. Restore READWRITE mode on DEST SR by running  `set_sr_mode_post_translation.sh`.
8. Create a new schema on SRC SR `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json" --data '{"schema": "{\"type\": \"string\"}"}' http://localhost:8081/subjects/testTopic-value/versions`
9. Check that new schema is not created on DEST Schema Registry because it isn't on IMPORT mode

#### Schema Translation creating new Subject on DEST SR

> [!hint]
> Since to create a new subject on DEST SR you will need to be on READWRITE mode there won't be chance to do the schema translation anymore


> [!abstract] Schema Translation Facts
> What you really need is having the destination on import mode and empty:
>  - Id will be preserved as is on the Source Topic
>  - If destSR is not on import mode Schema Translation doesn't work
>  - When destSR is not empty you can't put it on import mode so you will never be able to import new Schemas

> [!cite]
> Schema Translation is a great tool for fresh Schema Registry, you can run it as a one off think, or for use cases where destination Schema Registry will be on READ mode only, like of active-passive MRC scenarios


> [!seealso]
> You can include more than one topic but I would say that is better to have separate connector one just for schemas that is a one off thing and another one for topics.

### 2022-07-06-10:56 .NET Offset Translation

tags:

[[consumer offset translation]] [[replicator]]
team:

---

### Notes

For non JAVA Apps you will need to follow the Manual Offset Translation process described on [[Disaster Recovery on Multidatacenter Scenarios]]

Other (unsupported) option is [Kafka Offset Migrator](https://github.com/bb01100100/kafka-offsets-migrator)

team:

### Notes

> [!check]
> Scenarios to check:
> - Replicate `_schemas topic` from source directly with and without existing schema


#### Schema topic migration with fresh DEST SR

Create a new Schema on destination:
1. Create a datagen source connector (This will create a new subject on src Schema Registry) running `connect/submit_users_datagen.sh`
2. Create `schema_translation_replicator`  by running `replicator/submit_schema_migration_replicator.sh`
3. Check the schema was created on DEST Schema Registry with the same id by running `curl http://localhost:8082/subjects/datagen_users-value/versions/1`
4. Create a datagen source connector (This will create a new subject on src Schema Registry) running `connect/submit_orders_datagen.sh`
5. Check that the new schema was created on DEST Schema Registry by running `curl http://localhost:8082/subjects/datagen_orders-value/versions/1`

#### Schema topic migration, DEST SR with previously created subjects

Create a new Schema on destination:
1. Create a datagen source connector (This will create a new subject on src Schema Registry) running `connect/submit_users_datagen.sh`
2. Create `schema_translation_replicator`  by running `replicator/submit_schema_migration_replicator.sh`
3. Create a new schema on DEST SR `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json" --data '{"schema": "{\"type\": \"string\"}"}' http://localhost:8082/subjects/destTestTopic-value/versions`
4. Create a new schema on SRC SR `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json" --data '{"schema": "{\"type\": \"string\"}"}' http://localhost:8082/subjects/srcTtestTopic-value/versions`

> [!warning]
> Replicator instance will now be able to replicate anymore and will fail

### Notes

![[Pasted image 20220706170312.png]]

Create a new Schema on destination:
1. Create a datagen source connectors (This will create a new subject on src Schema Registry) running `connect/submit_users_datagen.sh` and `connect/submit_users_datagen.sh`
2. Set Import mode on Destiny SR by running `set_sr_mode_pre_translation.sh`
3. Create `schema_translation_replicator`  by running `replicator/submit_schema_translation_replicator.sh`
4. Set READWRITE mode on SR by running `set_sr_mode_pro_translation.sh`
5. Migrate topics with Consumer Offset Translator by running `replicator/submit_consumer_offset_translation_replicator.sh`
6. Start Java Consumer
7. Stop SRC Cluster
8. Change Java Consumer Config to DEST Cluster
9. Check consumer offset start from desired offset
